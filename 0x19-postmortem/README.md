<h1>PostMortem</h1>

<h2>Sumary Issue</h2>

<p>
  Between 14h34 and 14h47 GTM+2, on the 12th of may 2022, a big part, 68% of our
  users (the sub-one), face a problem, they can't have access to their maps to
  see where they are. As a GPS society, that was a big bug.</br>
  The root cause of this missfunctionnement was an typo error on the API url after
  a big changement, passing from the v1.12.17 to the v2.0.0
</p>

<h2>TimeLine</h2>

<p>
    14h34 - The code was put in production three minutes ago, some user dowload the new version.
    14h35 - We recieve Users feedback on twitter, due to they can't access anymore to the map.
    14h39 - After call everybody on the team, we decide to investigate in all folder to see what can be wrong, listen to log of servers.
    14h43 - We see a mistake in the const on the API_URL variable, gooogle was wrote, execpt that google got only two O.
    14h43 - Hell no, an user send us a picture, he was lost in the desert cause he can't use our application anymore, we had to make it quick
    14h43 - Thommas fall in the hallway because he was so happy to discover the bug. That was really fun to see.
    14H47 - EveryThing was pushed into the main repo, and put it in production. Tested and Approuved.
    14H47 - Our CM made a tweet to inform that everybody can be safe on the road now.
</p>

<h2>Root cause</h2>

<p>
    The cause was an mistake in the API_URL variable, that can't fetch data from the google servers.
    This was undectable if we didn't use the application in details.
    Thommas see it, after long minutes of works. Now he is at hospital, hope everything right for him, because he saved the app.
</p>

<h2>Corrective</h2>

<p>
    The first thing was to clear the hallway, to make it safe for the next time.
    Secondly, we note to make some deeper test, maybe engage QA engineer, to make sure that every single thing is tested before
    push it into prodution.
    For now, we just change all of our images to push it to all servers, make the last realese.
    I'm sure we will get an award to get a bug directly after pushing the new version. v2.0.0 to v2.1.0 in less than a quarter.
    Hope Thommas will get back soon.
